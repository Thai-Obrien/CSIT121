        <p>This has been a truly exciting experience for me. I was initially quite intimidated when I saw just how many tags were available
            to memorize. However, when the formula is broken down, it's actually not that difficult. This module has furthered my understanding
            of the HTML structure, as well as different ways to make the website more engaging.
